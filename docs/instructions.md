# Technical Assessment Instructions

## Challenge Overview
You are tasked with analyzing production performance data from an oil & gas operation to identify optimization opportunities and provide actionable insights. You will work with production data, equipment failure records, and well metadata to create a comprehensive analysis dashboard.

## Key Objectives
1. Analyze well performance trends and patterns
2. Identify opportunities for production optimization
3. Assess the impact of equipment failures on production
4. Evaluate cost efficiency across operations

## Required Analysis

### 1. Data Integration & Preparation
- Combine the three provided datasets appropriately
- Create the following calculated metrics:
  * BOE/D (Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day)
    - Use conversion factor: 1 BOE = 6 MCF of gas
  * Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) = Gas Production / Oil Production
  * Water-Oil Ratio (WOR) = Water Production / Oil Production
  * Runtime Efficiency = Actual Runtime / Calendar Days
  * Operating Cost per BOE = (Chemical Cost + Maintenance Cost) / Total BOE

### 2. Performance Analysis
Create visualizations that address:
- Production trends by region and well
- Well performance rankings based on key metrics
- Impact of equipment failures on production
- Cost metrics analysis
- Geographic distribution of performance metrics

### 3. Advanced Analytics
Identify and highlight:
- Wells with abnormal decline rates
- Patterns in equipment failures
- Correlation between chemical costs and production
- Cost optimization opportunities

## Deliverables

### 1. Interactive Dashboard
Create either:
- A Power BI dashboard (.pbix file)
- An Excel workbook with interactive elements (.xlsx file)

Your dashboard should include:
- Executive summary view
- Detailed analysis views
- Interactive filters and slicers
- Tooltips with relevant details
- Clear labels and titles

### 2. Written Summary
Provide a one-page summary (PDF) including:
- Key findings
- Identified optimization opportunities
- Recommendations for improvement
- Potential cost savings estimates

### 3. Technical Documentation
Document your approach including:
- Assumptions made
- Calculations and methods used
- Data quality issues encountered
- Suggestions for additional data that would be valuable

## Evaluation Criteria
